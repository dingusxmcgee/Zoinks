Birthed from the wilds of the 40's Discord, a collabration by Whydobearsxplod, Steve_Laroo, MelindaBerkinstock, Sickbabies, Mojo3354, KnoblessOblige and myself, the Zoinks! macropad represents the first gasket mount, uniform stagger macropad to explode onto the market.

Cutouts in the top and bottom of the case allow for small sections of foam to be inserted, creating a gasket isolated experience.
Additionally, the PCB sports an unprecedented omnidirectional footprint, allowing for MX, Choc, or Alps switches.

Designed for 12mm sockethead screws (https://www.mcmaster.com/91290a019) that screw directly into the top piece, and 6mm rubber bumpons ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073ST7Q27).
